RSA and AES solve different problems in practical cryptography. RSA is an asymmetric algorithm that uses a public/private key pair: the public key encrypts and the private key decrypts. This design enables secure key distribution and authentication, but RSA operations are computationally expensive and RSA is not intended for encrypting large files.

AES is a symmetric algorithm where the same secret key is used for encryption and decryption. AES-256 is efficient and is commonly used for encrypting files and bulk data. In real-world systems (such as HTTPS/TLS), asymmetric cryptography is typically used only during authentication and key establishment, after which a symmetric cipher like AES is used to protect the data stream due to its speed and scalability.
